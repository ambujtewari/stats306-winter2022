# Please read these instructions carefully

- Exam should be turned in via canvas file uploads by 11:59 pm Ann Arbor time on Thursday, Apr 21, 2022.
- Late submissions will **NOT** be accepted (unless there is a documented emergency or other major disruption beyond your control).
- You are allowed to use specific websites listed below, your own course notes, and a running R interpreter.
- _If you use any website(s) not specifically listed as allowed, you MUST list it in your exam._
- Failure to fully disclose resources that you used for the exam can result in loss of points.
- You are **NOT** allowed to copy answers from anyone/anywhere including any online sources! All work must be your own.
- No googling for answers! We reserve the right to run plagiarism detection software on your .ipynb files and report violations of academic integrity to the Dean's office.
- There are a total of 4 problems. Make sure you look at the entire exam.
- Make sure you only edit cells explicitly marked as solution cells.
- Like homeworks, upload the **pdf** version of your completed exam before the due date. You will be graded on the basis of the pdf version. Please ensure that your code and your output is clearly visible. If some of the code *we* supplied gets cut off, that's OK. **Also make sure that ALL cells your notebook run without errors PRIOR TO generating the pdf**.
- You may find that [binder](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ambujtewari/stats306-winter2022/main) does a better job of generating a pdf than google colab. However, binder is a free service with unpredictable availability. Another reason to **start working on the exam as early as possible**. Do not push your work to the last day!
- However, unlike homeworks, please **ALSO submit the actual notebook** (which has .ipynb extension). We reserve the right to ignore the notebook and only grade your exam based on the pdf you upload.
- Make sure these packages are loaded: `tidyverse`
- To ask clarification questions use the `#final` channel in slack. If you ask privately we will post the questions and answer publicly (after removing your name). We might not be able to answer questions on the last day (April 21). Please start early!

# Errata

I will post here all errors that were pointed out by students and corrected. These are listed in the order they were detected and corrected (newest at the top).

- Problem 4, part 4: `Create a tibble named `height_prob`" should be "Create a tibble named `heights_prob`"
- Problem 4, part 1: "Add a new column `new_heights`" should be "Add a new column `new_height`"
