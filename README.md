## Welcome to STATS 306 / DATA SCI 306

This is an introductory statistical computing course based on the R programming language and the tidyverse package. Topics covered include data wrangling, data visualization, basics of programming in R, and basics of statistical modeling.

- **Textbook**: We will use _R for Data Science_ by Grolemund and Wickham. It is available both as a printed book and as an [online resource](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
- **Canvas**: You should access the [Canvas class page](https://umich.instructure.com/courses/494634) for this course frequently. It will let you access important announcements, homework assignments, and exams. (requires UM login)
- **Slack**: The slack workspace for the course is at [um-wn22-stats306.slack.com](https://um-wn22-stats306.slack.com) (requires UM login)
- **Colab**: All lecture notebooks can be accessed in Google Colab by clicking here: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ambujtewari/stats306-winter2022/blob/master/)
- **Binder**: All lecture notebooks can be accessed in Binder by clicking here: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ambujtewari/stats306-winter2022/main)
- **Days and Times**: Mondays and Wednesdays, 10-11:30
- **Location**: 1202 [SEB](https://maps.studentlife.umich.edu/building/school-of-education) (for virtual lectures, you can find the zoom link in canvas and slack)

## Academic Integrity

The University of Michigan community functions best when its members treat one another with honesty, fairness, respect, and trust. The college promotes the assumption of personal responsibility and integrity, and prohibits all forms of academic dishonesty and misconduct. All cases of academic misconduct will be referred to the LSA Office of the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Education. Being found responsible for academic misconduct will usually result in a grade sanction, in addition to any sanction from the college. For more information, including examples of behaviors that are considered academic misconduct and potential sanctions, please see [https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/academic-integrity.html](https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/academics/academic-integrity.html)

## Accommodation for Students with Disabilities

If you think you need accommodation for a disability, please let me know at your earliest convenience. Some aspects of this course, the assignments, the in-class activities, and the way the course is usually taught may be modified to facilitate your participation and progress. As soon as you make me aware of your needs, we can work with the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) to help us determine appropriate academic accommodations. SSD (734-763-3000; [http://ssd.umich.edu/](http://ssd.umich.edu/)) typically recommends accommodations through a Verified Individualized Services and Accommodations (VISA) form. Any information you provide is private and confidential and will be treated as such.

## Mental Health and Well-Being

Students may experience stressors that can impact both their academic experience and their personal well-being. These may include academic pressures and challenges associated with relationships, mental health, alcohol or other drugs, identities, finances, etc. If you are experiencing concerns, seeking help is a courageous thing to do for yourself and those who care about you. If the source of your stressors is academic, please contact me so that we can find solutions together. For personal concerns, U-M offers a variety of resources, many which are listed on the [Resources for Student Well-being](https://wellbeing.studentlife.umich.edu/resources-list) webpage. You can also search for additional well-being resources [here](https://wellbeing.studentlife.umich.edu/well-being-resources).
